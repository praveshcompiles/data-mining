## Machine Learning Projects and Assignments

#### Employee Turnover Prediction:
A model that predicts from a dataset of 1 million employees, what type of employees are likely to leave the organization.
Compared accuracy, precision, recall of – Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, KNN, SVM; used regularization, plotted correlation
matrix and drew insights based on most significant features that contributed in employees’ decisions.


#### Movie Recommendation Engine
A system built using Movie Lens dataset to recommend personalized content based on past behavior of users using
collaborative filtering. Initially implemented the content-based and user-based memory approaches and then found that
item-based collaborative filtering approach gave better results.


#### Classification of Urban Objects
The dataset consisted of features extracted from aerial images of urban environments, which were originally collected to help with sustainable urban planning. The labels in the dataset describe the type of land that is represented by the image, such as trees or buildings. The dataset contains the short descriptions and numeric values about the aerial images and doesn't contain the actual aerial images. The task was to predict the type of urban object in the environment.
